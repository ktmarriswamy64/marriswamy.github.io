    <h2>MEN'S ARE REAL ARCHITECT OF SOCIETY</h2>
    <p>
There have been many examples of children who have grown up in the woods, who have entirely lacked socially acceptable behavior. Two sisters, Amala and Kamala, were rescued from the woods and were kept under observation. They failed to survive in the social world. They did not know how to eat, drink, or talk like other men. Thus, to become a normative creature, a man needs to live in a society.</p>

      <p>Ambedkar was a prolific student, earning doctorates in economics from both Columbia University and the University of London, and gaining reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics and political science.[13] In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's independence, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.

In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred upon Ambedkar. Ambedkar's legacy includes numerous memorials and depictions in popular culture.</p></tr>

          <h2>A.P.J.Abdul Kalam</h2>
          <p>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam, popularly known as the ‘Missile Man’ of India, was a source of inspiration for tens and thousands of Indians. A league apart, his life philosophy and teachings are not only admired by the older generation, but especially reminisced by young. Kalam’s prodigious rise from Rameswaram, a small but famous pilgrimage town in Tamil Nadu, led him to become one of the world’s most accomplished leaders.</p>
